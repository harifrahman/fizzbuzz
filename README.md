# fizzbuzz

## Easier problem statements for short coding - (first write unit tests first (TDD approach))

1. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.  
   - for multiples of three, print Fizz instead of the number
   - multiples of five, print Buzz. 
   - For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print FizzBuzz.
2. Write a function that will take a given string and reverse the order of the words. 
3. Write a function that will find the 50th number in the Fibonacci Sequence. 
4. Write a function that tests if a number, n, is a prime number.
